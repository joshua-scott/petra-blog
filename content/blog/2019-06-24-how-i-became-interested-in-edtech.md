description: A story about the last decade of my life describing my journey towards EdTech
---
My story began when I was 15, that means 10 years ago. Iâ€™ve always wanted to help people and that's why I chose to apply for vocational school, a social-humanitarian field of study. What does the social-humanitarian mean? It included bits of gerontology, special education, arts, general education, biology and personal assistance. You can probably imagine how broad, but at the same time complex my field of choosing was. Well, in the second year of our studies, we were supposed to find a practice, and I decided to go to a kindergarten for children with special needs. I spent two weeks being beaten up by a boy with autism spectrum disorders, and I was exhausted. However, at the end of the practice, something changed; I realised that he just craved my attention all along and finally, I gave it to him. The beating stopped, and we suddenly had a strong connection. And that was the time when I fell in love with autism, I knew this was what I was supposed to do.

The kindergarten became my second home. For the next 5 years, I visited them with any opportunity I got and also did a couple of my other practices for the vocational school and university there. I was enthusiastically active and tried to create different tools for individuals or for the group of children with autism.

There were about 4 children with whom I had established a similar connection. The last child I intensively worked with was a 3 year old boy with autism. It was tough for him to work with others, while he also dealt with behavioural problems. But with me, it was all okay because I made it clear that I understand him and that I really care --- you wouldnâ€™t believe it, but that was basically the secret. The last day came pretty fast, and it was difficult. He was supposed to leave to a new kindergarten, and I was supposed to move to Finland and go through my Erasmus studies. You probably hear all the time that children with autism have problems in understanding emotions, but he was just so aware of what was happening and it was unbelievable. He didnâ€™t want to spend a single minute with me and was hiding the whole day. When it was about the time his parents were supposed to pick him up, he looked at me, ran and hugged me, while he cried like never before. I didnâ€™t handle it very well. I started crying myself, but after a minute I realised I was supposed to be the adult and pull myself together.  And I did it....for a couple of minutes I was the strong adult, and then he left crying with his dad. I was broken-hearted, and the thought still makes me want to cry, to this day.

This was the moment when everything broke. I had thought I might become a kindergarten teacher or even a personal assistant, but it was not possible anymore. I was too emotionally invested, and this wouldnâ€™t do any good to anybody. Not to me and not to them. I left for Finland and had the best Erasmus year, just trying to focus on wanting to stay there and investing all my time into learning Finnish. I somewhat managed. I found an au pair job, working for an amazing Finnish family and honestly, I couldnâ€™t wish for more. I spent the whole year focusing on my Bachelor thesis and final oral exams that we still have in the Czech Republic. And after I was done with my Czech university, I started my Masterâ€™s studies at the University of JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤ (JYU). 

And then... I was lost again. It seemed that I was studying something that would never get me where I wanted to be. Wanting to focus on EdTech and possibly create something of my own, this Masterâ€™s program seemed to be of no use. On top of that, I had to work part-time as a personal assistant to sustain myself financially. I was feeling desperate. The first year of my studies was a real struggle, but at the end of the academic year, I decided not to get defeated by this and try to find my way towards EdTech somehow.

I took the organiserâ€™s role for The Researchersâ€™ Night at the JYU, to represent the international program, and since we got a lot of freedom, I convinced my team to make it EdTech focused. We did it, and it was amazing. We had robots, virtual reality glasses, a green screen, Kahoot, and created animated movies on tablets. It was so much fun! During that time, I applied to be a volunteer at Dare to Learn and Slush, the two most significant conferences in Finland with a decent focus on EdTech.

At the Dare to Learn, I spoke to a person from GraphoGame, which was actually developed at the JYU. He At Dare to Learn, I spoke to a person from GraphoGame, which was actually originally developed at JYU. He mentioned an internship opportunity, and I got all excited, as usual. This made me seek a recommendation from the GraphoGame/GraphoLearn father Heikki Lyytinen, and luckily, a connection gained through the Researchersâ€™ Night helped me reach him. We set up a meeting, and instead of discussing my internship recommendation, we started discussing my personal interests and my Masterâ€™s thesis. Within maybe 15 minutes I was talking about doing research on Ekapeli/GraphoLearn (to make it clear, thatâ€™s the research name connected to JYU and GraphoGame is the company that bought the idea from JYU) and autism. I was so excited that I immediately changed my current boring topic to this one and started all over. It was unbelievable! I was finally able to do research on something Iâ€™m interested in. It was not just working on some boring topic that was doable for my faculty (making it clear, I just couldnâ€™t find any supervisor who would be keen on doing something new and creative, so after a few months I just gave up and continued my bachelorâ€™s thesis topic).

In December 2018, I became a Slush volunteer, and it was eye-opening. I had a few meetings with different EdTech start-ups, and it gave me hope. They were really interested in my ideas and opinions, and I thought, well maybe I can really do it! After that, it all calmed down again a bit because I was so focused on my data collection, and I got a little side-tracked. After my data was collected, I saw the Dare to Learn call for volunteers. They were offering a position of a start-ups coordinator, and I got again so excited that I applied straight-away without even reading what I wrote on the application. A few days later, I had a missed call and also a message from a Dare to Learn employee. He said he would like to have a talk with me about the position. We had a nice talk and he said straight away that Iâ€™m suitable for the position and they would like to take me in.

Itâ€™s June 2019, Iâ€™m currently working on getting the start-ups to the event and also organising the Global EdTech Start-ups Award Scandinavian semi-final. I have no idea how I got here, but Iâ€™m grateful to every single moment that led me here, and also to all the people that made it possible. Over the past month, Iâ€™ve met so many amazing and influential people that I canâ€™t wrap my head around it. The only thing I know is that I love and enjoy it. I really hope that my future in EdTech is not as far away as I thought it would be. Well, letâ€™s see.
