If you had a chance to read my previous post about “How I became interested in EdTech”, you know what I’m going to talk about. For those who have no idea, you can check the previous post here: https://inclusiveedtech.com/2019-06-24-how-i-became-interested-in-edtech/

Firstly, I would like to explain what Ekapeli is. It is a Finnish version of gamified reading intervention focused on learning letter sounds correspondences (grapheme-phoneme), which are the building blocks of reading skill. The English version of the game is called GraphoLearn, although you might find a game called GraphoGame as well. Initially, the idea was developed in Jyväskylä, Finland by the University of Jyväskylä (JYU), Agora Center and Niilo Mäki Institute. To my understanding, the rights to the game were bought by now called Grapho Group, and now there is one academic and one privatised version of the game with separate developments. I’ve been working with the academic version and hence cooperating with personnel from JYU and Niilo Mäki Institute, who have been more than amazing and helpful with all my issues and requests. 

In this post, I would like to talk about the research preparation that had to be done before starting my data collection. It required lots of learning about new technology and combining several types of data collections.

There were only a few things I knew when I started with my research preparation, that I will work with Ekapeli, and I will test it somehow with children with autism. At the beginning I had no idea how I am going to do this; it was all one big unknown in my head. Only one thing was clear to me; I knew I wanted to see whether Ekapeli is a suitable intervention for children with autism. 

One of the first meetings was with Ulla Richardson, the person responsible for the background in game development. We discussed different versions of the game, log data and available assessments embedded within the different versions. Based on our conclusions, I chose to work with Ekapeli Maahanmuuttaja (a version for immigrants) and that simply because it was the only simplistic version that had the letter assessment embedded within itself. That meant that I wouldn't need to do any extra manual letter assessment with the kids during the data collection. 

After I chose the specific version of Ekapeli, I had a few meetings with my supervisor, Markku Leskinen. We discussed many options and possibilities on what could be done with such a topic. One of his many innovative suggestions was using eye-tracking software to discover how will the children react to the intervention and interface of the game. I was so excited since I had no idea that eye movement tracking could be even used for master’s level research. My supervisor gave me a contact on Jarkko Hautala from Niilo Mäki Institute, and Jarkko gave me an introduction to the SMI eye tracking software and hardware, which I decided to use for my thesis. From this point on, I had spent hours learning to work with the software and tried to discover all possible ways on how to use and analyse the eye movement tracking data.

Another big part of the research was to create all consent forms and privacy notices that ensured that the GDPR was correctly followed. Honestly, this took me at least two weeks; it was too complicated for a person who has never had to deal with such paperwork. I also had to apply for a research permit from the city where I was planning to collect the data. It was a stressful and lengthy process. The application itself wasn’t too complicated, but it took office more than a month to even process my application. In the end, it was only one of the many complications I had to face during my research (I will talk about these complications in the upcoming posts which will focus on the data collection process).

The last thing I had to think of before being able to start collecting my data, was how to create a whole-some picture about the children and their experience with Ekapeli by combining a suitable set of data. I ended up with seven different data collection methods - log data from Ekapeli, eye movement screen recording, video recording, child self-assessment, daily teacher assessment, parent questionnaire, and teacher questionnaire. Yeah, it sounds pretty huge for just a master’s thesis, but well, I’m a bit extreme when it comes to choosing on how I will work on projects that matter to me. 

Well, that was the summary of the pre-data collection process of my master’s thesis and how much had to be done before actually starting the fieldwork. It was long and stressful; I have to say that. However, at the same time, it was worth it, and I can say that I’ve been enjoying my master’s thesis research so far.

Next post will be focused on the Ekapeli & Autism data collection or my Dare to Learn volunteering experience, let’s see! Have a great day, you all!
