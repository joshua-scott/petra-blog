What is Dare to Learn? It has many descriptions: the festival of rethinking, the event for exploring the lifelong learning, the event that gathers together the biggest learning enthusiasts and experts, and I could continue with these big terms for a while. 

How did I get to know about Dare to Learn? Well, last year (2018) around this time of the year I was all desperate about my future and how I'm going to achieve what I want and I found out about the volunteer application for Dare to Learn and I applied straight away. I was a basic volunteer at one of the stages, helping the speakers to be on time at the right place. Being still included in the Facebook group of Dare to Learn volunteers, I had a chance to see the call for the different coordinator roles. Moreover, there it was, the role of the startups coordinator. I got all excited as always and applied without hesitating. I remember that they asked if I would like to have a second choice in case, I wouldn't be suitable for the position of the startups coordinator. Firstly, I automatically put the International coordinator as my second choice, but then I realised I don't want any second option. I want to be the startups coordinator. So I decided to have no second option. I went all in.

A missed call and a text message, that’s how it all started. I replied straight away and arranged the call with Antti (the head of partnerships) for later that day. The call went well, and my thesis topic was one of the reasons why I won over the position of startup coordinator. 

The first meeting was at Dare to Learn’s office, and I was super nervous. I hate being late, so I always end up being the first person in the room. Plus yeah, it’s always awkward. Well, this time I decided that maybe I shouldn’t be the first one, so I walked around the block to spare some time before I come into the office. I got inside the building, and there were already four people in (yay, I wasn’t the first awkward one). We moved into a conference room where we had spent a while by getting to know each other. After the official introductions in pairs were done, we continued with a casual talk about how I met a moose in the forest while babysitting two kids (it’s a great story, ask me about it if we ever meet in person). Moreover, that was it; I survived the first meeting for Dare to Lean. 

The second meeting of our team was at Korjaamo, Helsinki, the event’s future venue. I created a “great” impression straight from the beginning by not being able to find where the meeting was supposed to be. Luckily, Antti came to save me from the wild streets of Helsinki, and I got to take a tour around the venue. It looked great, and I believe we are going to make it even better, let’s see. 

The next step was to have a personal meeting with Antti to get an understanding of what my responsibilities will be and what is the position about. We met at one café and surprisingly, I was introduced to Henna, the CEO of Dare to Learn. Whenever someone says the word “CEO”, I get all scared of this important person and their attitudes. However, this CEO was just a normal, friendly human being with great enthusiasm. After that, Antti showed me documents related to startups from the last year’s preparation process, and we discussed who everything I should meet to get fully into my role of the startups coordinator. Then we joined Henna again, and we talked about all the great people I should meet and talk to and also about the Global EdTech Startups Awards (GESA) and the semi-final I will responsible for. I felt so energised and right after I got home, I started to work on creating a list of startups suitable for the event. 

Since then I’ve had a chance to meet and e-meet (nowadays it’s normal) many great people from the EdTech startup world. I’ve learnt a lot about how startups work and what kind of steps are there in the startup “evolution”. I’ve searched and read through hundreds of websites, Twitter profiles, and Facebook groups. I had a meeting with the board member of EdTech Finland Association, and it went super well – I still can’t get head around the fact that important people don’t have to be arrogant like I’m used to from my home country (Czech Republic). I wrote a first ever blog post that was published under my name, and I got great feedback on my efforts from my team members. 

However, nothing is just a happy story without any difficulties, is it? I’m supposed to have a summer holiday right now like the rest of the team, but I’m stressed about getting startups to apply for the GESA, getting them to come to the event and in general I feel like I’m not managing as well as I thought so. I know it will eventually get better, and I will manage somehow, but I guess that’s just the way I function. Whatever I work on, that matters, and I want it to be perfect.

Learn from me and don’t be such perfectionists, it makes your life more difficult than easier. Good luck to you all and bear with me!
