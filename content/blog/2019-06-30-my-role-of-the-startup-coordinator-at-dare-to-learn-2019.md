What is Dare to Learn? It has many descriptions: the festival of rethinking, the event for exploring the lifelong learning, the event that gathers together the biggest learning enthusiasts and experts, and I could continue gathering these big words for a while.

How did I get to know about Dare to Learn? Well, last year (2018) around this time of the year I was all desperate about my future and about how I'm going to achieve what I want. Then, I found out about the volunteer application for Dare to Learn and applied straight away. I was a basic volunteer at one of the stages and my main task was assisting the speakers with being on time and at the right place. Being still included in the Facebook group of Dare to Learn volunteers, I had seen the application for coordinator roles at Dare to Learn 2019. I looked into it right away and there it was, the role of the startups coordinator. I got all excited as always and applied without hesitating. I remember that they asked if I would like to have a second option in case I wouldn't be suitable for the position of the startups coordinator. At first, I automatically put the International coordinator as my second option, but then I realised that I don't want to give them a choice to vote me out. I wanted to be the startups coordinator. That's why I decided to have no second option. I went all in.

A missed call and a text message, that’s how it all started. I replied straight away and arranged the call with Antti (the head of partnerships) for later that day. The call went well, and my thesis topic was one of the reasons why I won over the position of the startups coordinator. 

The first meeting was at Dare to Learn’s office, and I was super nervous. I hate being late, so I always end up being the first person in the room. It always feels awkward and that's why I decided that maybe this time I shouldn’t be the first one again. I walked around the block to spare some time before coming into the office. I got inside the building, and there were already four people in (yay, I wasn’t the first awkward one). We moved into a conference room where we had spent a while by getting to know each other. After the official introductions in pairs were done, we continued with a casual talk about how I met a moose in the forest while babysitting two kids (it’s a great story, ask me about it if we ever meet in person). That was it, I survived the first partnerships meeting!

The second team meeting was at Korjaamo, Helsinki, the event’s future venue. I created a “great” impression straight from the beginning by not being able to find where was the meeting supposed to be. Luckily, Antti came to save me from the wild streets of Helsinki, and I got to fill in the volunteering agreemen and take a tour around the venue. It looked great, and I believe we are going to make it even better looking in September, let’s see. 

The next step was to have a personal meeting with Antti to get an understanding of what my responsibilities will be and what is the position of startups coordinator about. We met at one café and surprisingly, I was introduced to Henna, the CEO of Dare to Learn. Whenever someone says the word “CEO”, I get all scared of this important person and their attitudes (that's how it works in Czech). However, this CEO was just a normal, friendly human being with a great enthusiasm. After this, Antti showed me documents related to startups from the last year’s preparation process, and we discussed who everything I should meet to get fully settled down in the position. Then we joined Henna again, and we talked about more people that I should meet and talk to. We also discussed the Global EdTech Startups Awards (GESA) and the Scandinavian semi-final I will responsible for. I felt so energised and right after I got home, I started to work on creating a list of startups suitable for this year's Dare to Learn themes. 

Since then I’ve had a chance to meet and e-meet (nowadays it’s pretty normal) many great people from the EdTech startup world. I’ve learnt a lot about how startups work and what kind of steps are there in the startup “evolution”. I’ve searched and read through hundreds of websites, Twitter profiles, and Facebook groups. I had a meeting with a board member of EdTech Finland Association, and I wrote a first ever blog post that was published under my name, check it here: <http://www.daretolearn.fi/blog/want-to-reach-the-world-of-learning-startup-booths-for-sale-now>.

However, nothing is just a happy story without any difficulties, is it? I’m supposed to have a summer holiday right now like the rest of the team, but I’m stressed about getting startups to apply for the GESA, and getting them to come to the event.  In general I feel like I’m not managing it all as well as I thought so. I know it will eventually get better, and I will deal with it somehow, but I guess that’s just the way I function. I guess I might be a perfectionist when it comes to projects I work with.

Learn from me and don’t be such a "freak", it will make your life easier. Good luck to you all and bear with me!
