description: Description of the data collection process and its challenges
---
As I mentioned in my previous post about the preparation for my data collection, I was lucky to get a great teacher to collaborate with and most importantly, her class full of excellent children with autism. 

The first meeting at the school went pretty well. I had a chance to spend some individual time with a few of the kids. Also, I got to observe their behaviour and abilities during the class which should help me to get somewhat prepared for what was going to come. After this meeting, the teacher and I agreed on the first four sessions and settled down dates and times for the experiments.

Right after the school visit, I went to the University of Jyväskylä (my alma mater) and picked up all of the needed equipment. Firstly, I went to Kärki (The Department of Psychology) and picked up the equipment needed for recording the eyey movements - the SMI laptop with its sensor and chin rest that helps to keep the eye gaze stable. From there, I went straight to Ruusupuisto (The Faculty of Education) where I picked up two video cameras and two stands that were going to assist me with filming the experiments. I remember I regretted picking it all up at once, it was all so heavy and uncomfortable to carry as you can see in the picture below, but well, I survived.

I had spent the whole rest of Friday and the weekend by getting ready for the big first day. Already then, the SMI laptop wasn’t working as well as I would want it to, but I had no other choice than keep up with it. There was one moment when I got so frustrated with the SMI software that I called friends and cried on the phone like a little girl. I was super stressed, but somehow, I managed to make it work at the end of the weekend.

And there was the first day. I came to the school at 9 am, and the teacher showed me a little room, it was more like storage really, where I was going to have my space and where I can conduct the experiments. I took the first child in and was super shaky since everything was suddenly more difficult than during the home trials. No wonders I was shaking, everything was failing. After finishing the first day, I was exhausted and desperate. Most of the eye movement recordings were useless because the background didn’t get recorded for some unknown reason, and the videos had just a grey background. It also failed to track the children’s eye gaze during the calibration. The tracking failure caused that the SMI didn’t record any of the eye movements, and all was for nothing. I went home, rested a little and then had spent hours by reading through the SMI manuals. I had spent hours by testing the calibration options like adding sounds and pictures, and also changing the number of calibration points. The imagine below displays how does the basic verison of the calibration look like. It shows pulsing points to gain eye gaze attention. After the research subject looks at the spot, it disappers and either continue to the next one or proceeds directly to the task.

Meanwhile, I was also looking for some software that would help with the background recording in case the SMI continues failing. I had read through a list of available background recorders and finally chose one called FlashBack that I decided to use as a replacement for my failed SMI recordings.

The second day went a little better than the previous one, but there were still many issues. I tried to make the calibration process successful by using only one calibration point on the screen, but it worked only in one of the six children. In the rest of them, I decided to use zero point calibration and hoped that this was the way to go. I had managed to record the eye movements, but the SMI background recording failed again. Luckily, I had the FlashBack background recording software as a back-up. Although, this meant that I would need to somehow put the eye movement videos and the background videos on top of each other to get what I was supposed to gain automatically. Below, you can see three pictures - the first is what SMI recorded, the second is what FlashBack recorded, and the third is the combined video.

I managed to sync both videos based on the mouse clicks in Adobe Premiere. It took many hours, but I think I did a good job.

The next five days went mostly well. At the end of the data collection process, I had finished the trial with five out of six children since one of them went on a long holiday. The children were great, but the latter the experiment, the worse behaviour I observed. Mostly, the reason behind the worsen behaviour was that they got too comfortable with me and started joking around a lot, and also some of them got a little bored and didn’t want to play the game anymore. 

Overall, I would rate this life experience as quite successful and positive. I know I could have done better, but at the same time, I know I could have done way worse. The data collection part was a great experience, and it proved to me that I can do it! I believe I can test the already existing apps and make them better and more accessible for children with autism. It might take years before I figure out exactly how, but I will get there, I won’t give up.

Thank you for reading this post, and I hope you enjoyed it!
