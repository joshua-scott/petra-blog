  and solutions

In the previous post, I talked about the data collection part of my research. In case you haven’t read the last post, check it out so you can keep up with my progress!

In this post, I would like to talk about the data analysis and the software that I had to use to get through it. Firstly, I had to get my eye movement videos from the “great” SMI laptop that I used for my data collection. And I guess you won’t be surprised to hear that it was not easy. Everything regarding the SMI software has been so complicated ever since I started with it. I came to Kärki building in Jyväskylä, where I had a technician’s support in case something goes wrong. It went wrong, and even the technician had no idea how was that possible. Initially, I was supposed to click the “import” button and then get ready videos with the recorded background of the screen, the mouse clicks and the eye movements. 

It was not enough that the background didn’t get recorded in any of the videos. Moreover, there were some issues with the license and codecs in that laptop as well. Hence it didn’t allow me to download the videos from the data I collected. I had spent there 3 hours, trying other laptops which didn’t work, changing different settings and options but nothing. The technician tried all of these mentioned as well in case I was just a stupid person and was missing something, but nothing. 

After I had waisted another 3 hours of my life, I decided to leave. I was almost crying. Exhausted and disappointed, I went to meet my supervisor and share the “great” news with him. I remember I was so glad that day that he was my supervisor because he calmed me down and made everything manageable again. We agreed on the future steps, and this first one was to get the videos out of the laptop somehow. I had only one option on my mind, and it was to screen record every single video while playing it on the SMI laptop. And I did it by using the FlashBack software. I had spent hours and hours by watching the videos while recording them and finally had a bunch of videos in AVI format ready. 

The next step was to somehow match the separate background recordings with the eye movement recordings, as I mentioned in the previous post (check it for pictures). The only option on how to match them was based on the mouse clicks. You wouldn’t believe how grateful I was that I decided to record the mouse clicks with the eye movements (it was not compulsory to do so). I had spent hours by matching the videos in Adobe Premiere that I decided to use for all the video preparation that had to be done. It was a real pain, but again I managed, and after all that struggle, I had to face during working with the SMI software, I was done. Finally! It was a terrible user experience, and it’s good that they as a company decided not to continue with their product anymore.

After finishing my eye movements videos, I had finally prepared to create a multiple screen recording where I will have the front and rear camera recordings of the session and the eye movement videos. Again, I had spent hours and hours by matching the voices from each video with the others in Adobe Premiere. I would say that this was more difficult than matching the clicks of the mouse in the previous task. I had to carefully listen to each of the videos multiple times and make sure that it’s going to be as precisely synced as possible. I think I did a decent job. Some of the videos might have a little echo going on, but I think it’s okay. As a final “product” I had a video with three screens and could play through the experiment as it was at that actual time and that all to help me see everything that had happened during each of the session.

We agreed with my supervisor that I would use a program called ELAN for my video analysis. It’s a software created for research in languages. However, it can be used for whatever videos you want to analyse. Of course, there was a slight issue with this program as well, how unexpected. It didn’t accept videos in AVI format, and I had to transfer all videos into the MP4 format. More hours ridiculously spent, and I finally managed to open the video in ELAN. It has been quite easy to use the program. You have to start by creating tiers that are the things you want to analyse. In my case, it was On-task behaviour, Sound to Letter reactions, Off-task behaviour, and a type of Behaviour that appeared during the Off-task. To mark specific situation on your timeline, you have to drag the cursor of your mouse from the start till the end of the activity. After you have marked the whole situation, you double click and type in a chosen label. I was mostly using time labels since all the numerical data was going to go to the SPSS for further analysis.

The most challenging was marking the Sound to Letter reactions in my video analysis. What does it mean? I was looking into how long it takes to the child to click on the letter after hearing the letter sound. Children didn't have to choose the correct letter to make it count since the point was to measure the sound-letter correspondence speed of reaction no matter the results.

This is basically how far I’ve gotten so far. I had managed to put some numbers into the SPSS program already but let’s talk about it in the Ekapeli & Autism Data Analysis part II. 

Thank you for reading my post; hopefully, you enjoyed reading it and have a great day!
