  Looking back at the few days before Dare to Learn, the actual event, and the
  few weeks after Dare to Learn.
---
Wow, simply wow to all the people who helped to make this fantastic event! I can’t believe that it’s over now, and it still makes me feel super emotional. These people I had a pleasure to work with grew on me, and suddenly it’s time to say goodbye..but well, as Freddie Mercury said: ‘Show must go on’, and we all have to continue our own paths from now on.

The Dare week (16.-20.9.) was so hectic. It feels like I just saw it from a train, it passed by so quickly that I haven’t even noticed. Monday was the only day that I could work from home, and I was mostly dealing with last preparations for the event such as GESA schedule adjustments and combining the semi-finalists’ presentations to create one final presentation to avoid switching between documents, etc. I have to say that putting together 9 different presentations is not as easy task as I imagined. I expected a few issues with compatibility but not one big disaster. However, after 3 hours of misery and frustration, I had the combined presentation ready to go! On Tuesday morning, I checked the presentation once more and, in the afternoon, I went to Korjaamo to finish the placards for Hacking Higher Education and GESA and to prepare folders with papers and forms for the GESA judges.

On Wednesday, we had a building day – it was exhausting but great to see how Korjaamo was taking the shape of Dare to Learn. After all the building and preparations, we had a glass of wine with my colleague Kaisa and went home to get as much sleep as we could. It was the last night before Dare to Learn…I remember I was super stressed and nervous but also excited as well to see how is it all gonna go.

I arrived at 7am on Thursday together with Dare to Learn’s CEO Henna (we met on the bus by accident), we started with a making everything ready, and suddenly people were coming in. My startup area was pretty easy to take care of, and I had help from my two great volunteers that managed to deal with everything that happened there. Hence, I was helping wherever I was needed, but mostly at the matchmaking and main stage area.

It was lots of fun, and I also got to participate in one workshop regarding international students and their working opportunities in Finland. It was great to see that key players like TE-toimisto are trying to make a change and improve the lives of foreigners in Finland. I hope and believe that one day it will all work the way it should and although foreigners should study Finnish, it shouldn’t be the critical factor in the process of getting a job. I’m thrilled to see that there are so many welcoming companies like Dare to Learn that create such significant events in English and are welcoming to all volunteers from different backgrounds. After the workshop it all went super fast, and suddenly it was evening, and I was going home. I was super tired after the first day, but the most stressing moment was still awaiting. Yeah, I’m speaking of the GESA semi-final.

Friday was even busier than Thursday. I was so stressed and wanted everything to go well, so I started making all ready for GESA already at 1pm (GESA began at 3pm) and didn’t even think of eating lunch. After 14:30 I moved with my volunteers to the kino stage, and there it was. All of the judges were there, the startups‘ representants were arriving, and I was so excited to meet them all finally! During the GESA preparation, I decided not to mention the judges' names before the semi-final to make it fair and exciting, but now I can finally tell you about them. I was so happy and proud that these fantastic five people decided to be the judges for GESA. The first person who agreed to be the judge was Heini Karppinen, the chairman of the Edtech Finland Association and CEO of Mehackit. I had a meeting with her before the summer, and we had a great discussion about Dare to Learn, its side events and startups. Already then I was sure she was gonna be a fantastic judge for our semi-final. Also, I have to give her credit for the public voting, it was her idea, but I made it happened. 

The second person who agreed to be the judge was Jonathan Viner. He’s such a positive and sweet person, I couldn’t believe my eyes and ears during our first Skype call. He had been so encouraging and grateful for every little thing, it was such a pleasure to have this kind of person on board. Also, I would like to share with you his amazing newsletter that he launched a month ago. It’s called The Nordic EdTech News, and it’s out every two weeks. You can sign up for this vast collection of EdTech news from Nordics and Baltics here: https://nordicedtech.substack.com/. 

The third person was Märt Aro, the chairman of N8 Nordic EdTech Forum and the CEO of DreamApply. He had also been very supportive during the GESA preparation process, and I would like to thank him again for backing me up during convincing MindCET about adding Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to our semi-final. Thanks to him and his support, I managed to push, and we created this fantastic semi-final including Nordic and Baltic countries. 

The fourth person that agreed to become the judge was Panu Forsman, my degree coordinator and lecturer from the University of Jyväskylä. Thanks to one great conversation I got to have with him during my studies, I knew that his innovative approach towards education and his knowledge of pedagogy will bring a tremendous extra spark to the judging process. 

The last, but not the least, was Sophie Bailey, the founder of The EdTech Podcast. I was so excited to hear that she was going to join since I’ve been a big fan of her podcast and it’s so cool to meet someone you are listening to that often. She is doing such a great job with her podcast and has actually launched a new podcast called The VocTech podcast focused on redefining vocational education. You can check it all here: https://theedtechpodcast.com/.

Now when you know all about the judges, I can get back to the actual semi-final. Akseli Rouvari (such an amazing and inspiring person), the GESA host, went on the stage and started all I had been waiting for since April – the Scandinavian semi-final! And I was just stood there (too nervous to sit in case something was going to go wrong) watching these fantastic people pitching and interacting with each other. I was soo proud. I think I was even prouder than during my bachelor degree graduation. It was amazing, simply incredible. It all went super well, and suddenly there I was checking the results of the public vote winner and listening to the judges‘ discussion about who should win the GESA semi-final. I wish I had recorded it. It was so inspiring to hear these experts‘ opinions and arguments. And finally they agreed on one name.

Firstly, I went on the stage to announce the public vote winner. I was not scared, I was not nervous, it was an unbelievable feeling. Usually, I would be all shaky shaky and red, but then, I was just so proud, and it was all okay and natural for me to speak on stage. I thanked everybody and announced the Public vote winner – BeED (check their product here: https://www.beed.world/). After that, Heini Karppinen announced the Scandinavian GESA winner – Four Ferries (check their solution here: https://fourferries.com/en/) and it was over. There we pictures taken, and suddenly I was thanking all the judges for coming and giving them chocolates and drink tickets as a thank you gift.

And actually, I also got some gifts from Sophie Bailey – The VocTech Podcast sticker that is proudly placed on my laptop and The VocTech & The EdTech podcast mug that I’m in love with, thank you again, Sophie!

Wow, what a journey! After all of that, I felt so proud but also super tired and empty. It was all gone. The months of work and preparation, and it was done, I was done. I went to the Dare quarters at Korjaamo and just sat down and ate quite a few liquorice chocolate balls (yummy) to deal with my exhaustion and hunger. The event was done, the last speech at the main stage was far gone, and we had to clean and deconstruct most of the things at Korjaamo before 18:00. After all was somewhat cleaned and deconstructed I was genuinely ready to go home. I started saying goodbye to the team members..firstly to Antti who was an amazing little boss, a sun that was shining on all of us despite his own massive list of responsibilities and worries. Thank you Antti for all the great meetings, lots of laughter and in nice company! Then to Anni, who made me cry by saying how professional and great I was. Thank you, Anni, for being always so positive, enthusiastic and especially encouraging! The third person was Elina who was in charge of the tickets. She was also super lovely by telling me how professional and organised (what?!) I was. I would like to say it was my pleasure to work with someone like you, a strong, positive and super organised woman with a super knowledge of Excel sheets. Then there were more and more people that I hugged, and it ended by me talking to our super energetic producer Nina who “convinced” me to stay. We got to speak, and at the end I was leaving Korjaamo together with the last people (ups, didn’t see it coming haha, but it was fun!). 

I got home, ate some food and got a great deserved sleep. Saturday was a calm day, but on Sunday morning, I woke up ill (no surprise there). I genuinely expected that since that always happens to me after a long period of stress and hard work. I was supposed to participate at HELwecan! on Monday, but unfortunately I had to cancel. Luckily, they had an online stream, so I at least got to watch the main talks and hopefully learn something new as well. However, already on Sunday I was getting into this post-big task “depression”, and it lasted a whole week. One week of just surviving but not living, just watching people around but not really participating in society or nothing else. Well, the only thing I managed to join at was the big Climate Strike on Friday 27th with the company of Dare team (thank you again), but that was it.

This week (30.9.-6.10.) was simply focused on my thesis except for Thursday when I got invited to the DigiEduHack VIP lunch in Espoo. In case you don’t know what DigiEduHack is, check the website here: https://digieduhack.com/en/. I was not supposed to be there at first, but our GESA Public vote winner couldn’t participate, so I got to take their place. I was so lucky since I had a chance to have lunch with the most influential people like the European Commission for Education and other prominent players in the area of learning innovation (I felt so special). During the lunch, Solja (my colleague) received a message about us presenting Dare to Learn in the afternoon?! We were surprised since this was not planned at all, but at the end, we created a simple presentation and presented Dare to Learn, GESA & Hacking Higher Education (http://www.daretolearn.fi/hhefinland.html) on the stage of DigiEduHack. I was so nervous; I was shaking like crazy, and at some points I almost didn’t remember all the judges’ names. However, I managed, and it got recorded, so now I’m “famous”. Hopefully it was one more step that counts to get closer to getting a real job.
