  How do the Early Intervention services in the Czech Republic work? Are they
  using assistive tools and technology?
---
Hello everybody! This time I decided to tell you a little about Czech social service called Early Intervention. Despite the fact that it is pretty much my bachelor degree, I decided to do an interview with an early intervention counsellor, my best friend and amazing person dedicated to this topic Markéta Lokajová. Firstly, I asked her to introduce herself and then to answer my questions about their services, assistive tools and technology. So here we go!

Hello, I’m Markéta, and I’m 25 years old. I work as a counsellor in Early Intervention services. Ever since I was young, I wanted to work with children and especially with those with disabilities. After finishing high school I decided to apply to one of the best universities in the Czech Republic. I spent three years studying Early childhood special education at Palacký University in Olomouc. After getting my bachelor degree I had worked as a teacher’s assistant at primary school for one year. I was an assistant to a child with childhood autism who was integrated into this school. Thanks to this experience I applied for a master’s degree in Counselling – Early Intervention at the same University. This studies got me closer to the working opportunities and one of my teachers, nowadays my boss had offered us work practice opportunities. I’m currently working as an early intervention counsellor and at the same time preparing for my final exams and master’s thesis defence at the Palacký University. In my free time I like to read, listen to music, travel and also organising camps and other events for children.

Isn’t she amazing? I told you so. Now let’s learn something about how the Early Intervention services work and what kind of technology are they using and how.

**1. How would you introduce an Early Intervention (EI) service** (in the Czech language "Raná péče") **to a person who has never heard of it?**

EI is a social service provided by non-governmental and non-profit organisations that are financially supported by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. This allows EI to offer their services to all families with prematurely born children or babies with disabilities. The EI service is free of charge and can be provided to a family during the first 7 years of a child's life. After the age of 7, new social services or school _facilities*_ replace the Early Intervention service.

_\*School facilities that most likely take over in cases of children with disabilities are Pedagogical-psychological counselling centres (PPC) or Special pedagogical centres (SPC). PPCs provide their services mostly to children with learning disabilities and behavioural problems. On the other hand, SPCs focus primarily on children with intellectual, physical, visual or hearing impairments or on children with impaired communication abilities, comorbidities and autism spectrum disorders._

**2. What disability is your branch of Early Intervention focused on?**

[Centrum pro dětský sluch Tamtam o. p. s.](http://www.detskysluch.cz/?lang=en) (Center for child's hearing Tamtam) provides services to families with children with hearing impairments. This centre consists of two branches that are taking care of families from all around the Czech Republic, and the office I work for is located in Olomouc. In addition to that, we are providing professional social counselling that assists families with issues regarding social affairs. Lastly, we offer informational and educational services most focused explicitly on teaching Czech sign language by our sign language instructors. 

**3. How does it work if a child has more than one disability, are you collaborating with other Early Intervention services?**

As I mentioned, our priority is hearing impairment, so in case a child has a hearing impairment, we can start providing them with our services. In this situation, it is not crucial whether another EI is working with the family. However, some EIs have in their methodological instructions that they can't provide their services to a family that already has support from another EI. In case there is another EI involved, we always agree on at least one joint consultation where we discuss the roles and goals of our work. This takes place to prevent any future disagreements or usage of different strategies in one family. It is a question of the family's priorities and current issues. In case the biggest priority for the family is to deal with the child's hearing impairment, we are the leading EI service. We are partners to the families, and they get to decide what do they wish for or not. 

**4. Could you describe your typical day?**

Well, my typical day – it's quite tricky since every day is a unique one. However, if I would need to generalise, my usual workday would probably look something like this:

As the first thing in the morning, I'm preparing for individual consultations. The preparation is based on what we discussed at our previous meeting with the family or based on what the family is currently dealing with. To help us navigate through each family journey, we create an individual plan with each family. This plan has one-year goals, and together with the family, we are trying to fulfil them. After that, I'm preparing activities based on the child's age, and finally, I take clients folder and hit the road. We are operating all around Moravia, Silesia, Vysočina and Pardubice region; hence, we usually spend a lot of time travelling. 

The consultations take places in the families' environment, and upon arriving, I explain to the parents what is today's plan and the consultation can start. Each session lasts approximately one hour and a half, but it's possible to make it even 3 hours long if needed. At the end of each consultation, we agree on the next date for our meeting.

When I get back to the office, I work on the consultation report, which is essential to keep track of the process and allows us to control the situation. If needed, I answer emails or call and text the families, and after that, I'm leaving home. 

To assure the professional growth of us consultants, we take part in many EI conferences and trainings. We also have joint meetings and supervision sessions (in the Czech context it means professional feedback and psychological support and other vital issues related to this type of work). It is very independent and creative work, you never know what is waiting for you.

**5. Are you lending any assistive tools to the families? How does it work? Are you also lending any technical tools?**

Yes, we are lending toys, books and other assistive tools. Usually, we show the family how to work with a specific tool at the consultation session and then it's lent to them. We have a document that serves the purpose of lending where we mark the code of the tool and at the moment of returning parents mark the date of return and sign the document. When it comes to technical assistive devices, the most lent ones are tablets since not many families can buy those themselves due to financial reasons. 

**6. Are you using any specific technology to improve a child's health or education?**

Yes, we are using computer programs that teach children how to breathe correctly or how to improve sight in children with comorbidities. 

**7. Which technology do you often recommend to families?**

The most recommended is an application called "Znakujte s námi" (sign with us), that helps parents with sign language vocabulary and was developed by our organisation.

**8. Could you name three things you would improve regarding Early Intervention services?**

•	Financial support

•	Availability of other, usually more expensive assistive tools

•	Screening in new-borns – to assure that they will get to us as soon as possible

**9. Would you recommend this service to people abroad, should they create something similar in their countries?**

Yes, definitely! It's a fantastic service that helps families in challenging situations.

**10. Any positives or negatives you would like to mention regarding your job?**

It's a beautiful job, but it's time-consuming and psychologically demanding! It needs diligence and lots of self-criticisms to prevent counsellors from stopping professional growth and self-development. The financial support is discussed a lot in the Czech Republic, and it should improve. Also, one of the biggest positives of this job is helping families with children with hearing impairment and showing them that their child is "normal".

Wow! What a fanstastic interview! I hope you have learnt something new about the Early Intervention services in the Czech Republic. Now I would like to hear about similar services in your coutries, are they even existing? Let me know on [Twitter!](https://www.twitter.com/petra_kucharova)
