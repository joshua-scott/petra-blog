  Discussing my current situation of job seeking, networking, possible
  entrepreneurship and podcasting
---
Hello everybody, I would like to apologise about taking time with this new blog post. I’ve been busy or at least I’ve been trying to be. My current life situation (finishing studies and looking for a job) made me think a lot. I’ve been applying for jobs all around but nothing. I have even sent applications to other countries than Finland but nothing. The only reply I get is “we decided to pursue further with other candidates”.

It puts you down, and it makes you feel like you are useless and alone. However, I can’t let it drag me down entirely because then I would break, and I don’t want that! I’ve been crying a lot because being unemployed in a foreign country is not easy. I struggle emotionally, physically and financially, which affects every aspect of my life. But not everything is terrible. I’m lucky to have great people around — the right people who support me every day and who let me cry to them without judging. And then at the end of the crying, they pick me up and send me off again to push and work hard to get to the desired destination called job. 

I wanted to write the above to encourage other people in a similar situation in Finland or other countries. We must stay strong and try harder because that’s the only way how we will ever get a chance. And I’m planning on getting one. 

Hence, I would like to tell you about what I’ve been doing to make it work for myself and what projects I’m working.

Firstly, there is still my master’s thesis. It is focused on testing Ekapeli, a computer-based reading intervention, with children with autism spectrum disorders. I finally finished analysing the data, and I have created my first three graphs in SPSS and have already written a few opening pages. My supervisor is trying to convince me to write an academic article about this topic as well. Still, I’m not sure that my financial situation will allow me to spend another few months on something I don’t even want. 

Secondly, I’ve been pushing myself to go out and participate in workshops, conferences and meetups. In the beginning, it was challenging since I was all anxious and not feeling social at all. I just wanted to stay home in my comfort zone. But how many good things happened if you keep staying in your pyjamas? It has been a couple of weeks since I started going out more and I’m feeling better about all this. I’ve been privileged to meet some cool and interesting people over the weeks. I went to EdTech meetup, Mental Health workshop, UNTIL Inclusion and Diversity report launch event, I’ve done some little things for Dare to Learn and their Higher Education Innovation Partners (HEIP), etc.

 I was also encouraged to do something by hearing similar stories to mine. And if I could change it for myself and the others at the same time, that would be great! So, I’m giving myself a few months until after Christmas, and if nothing comes up, I will make it work for myself. I will work on building a startup, and that might also fulfil my need to help people. I’m tired of seeing all of us, highly educated foreigners (especially those in education) who are not getting a chance to work. There must be something done!

Thirdly, speaking of making it work for myself, I’ve been working on a podcast with one of my dearest friends. I won’t be telling you for now what it is going to be about, but I would like to tell you about the process of making it. There are so many things you must think of before even recording the first episode. What themes will you have and what happens after you use all of them? You have to create an image that will represent your podcast. Then there is also the music and sounds that you need for your episodes. They are easy to get for free, but each website that provides them has different rules on how to reference those. Also, you need to have a microphone, a good quality one. I was lucky that my boyfriend owns one, so I get to borrow that.

I had to test it, of course, to see how it sounds and what is the best place in our apartment for recording. I had to watch many videos on how to set the mic and make it sound the best. And of course, I had to choose a recording and editing software, and Audacity seems to be the most available one right now. We are recording our first episode on Sunday this week, so have fingers crossed for us! Hopefully, you will be able to hear soon all about that.

Thank you for reading this post! In case you are in a similar situation to mine, I hope it made you feel encouraged and ready to push more! I’m opened to a variety of projects so in case you have one or know about something, please let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/petra_kucharova) or [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/petra-kucharova). 

Have a great day and smile!
