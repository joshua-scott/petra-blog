  Introducing the excellent initiative lead by Mozilla that helps create a rich
  human voices dataset to improve accessibility for all.

According to Mozilla's website, “Common Voice is part of Mozilla’s initiative to help teach machines how real people speak” (1). But why should we teach machines such a skill? Well, as you already guessed, the reason is to improve the accessibility. This data set could bring a significant change into devices using voice control such as computers, laptops, phone and intelligent personal assistants such as Alexa, Siri or Cortana. 

In one of my previous blog posts, I worked on testing Apples’ new feature called Voice Control and compared it with Windows’ Speech Control. It was exciting to test both functions, but as a foreigner speaking English, I encountered issues with speech recognition and was quite often misunderstood. Mozilla states that Common Voice dataset is there to enable anyone to build any application that requires voice data such as speech recognition. 

I had a chance to test only the English version of this data collection process; however, there are more data available in other languages such as Swedish, Russian, German, Estonian and others. In addition to that, more languages are coming, such as the Czech language that is my mother tongue. Mozilla even provides a [visual interpretation](https://voice.mozilla.org/en/languages) of progress in all languages.

But how do they collect the data? It is pretty simple, and you can help with the data collection yourself. Go to the website and click donate and/or validate voice.

Let’s say you choose to verify voices first. You will see a short text and then a play button underneath this text. Click play and listen while checking the correctness of the read text. You can validate the accuracy by clicking on yes or no button. Each validation consists of five rounds, and you can skip a validation round if needed.

Underneath text there is play button and YES button with thumbs up and NO button with thumbs down.

The same counts in case of donating your voice to the data set. You will see a text that you can pre-read and then hit the record button while reading aloud. You can check the recording, and if needed, you can re-record your voice. As in the validation part, you have five rounds of recording to do. It is super easy, and I would encourage everybody to help the good cause. And in case you don’t feel comfortable with donating your voice, please at least go through the validation round.

You might be thinking what about privacy. Mozilla is in general good with confidentiality, and on their [website](https://voice.mozilla.org/en/faq#sentence-collection) they ensure that all voice clips are stripped of personally-identifying information. 

And what if you would want to use the data? Well, Mozilla makes it easy and lets you download the data under the CC0 licence on their [Datasets page](https://voice.mozilla.org/en/datasets).

In case you have some other questions regarding this project, I would recommend you to check Mozilla's [FAQ](https://voice.mozilla.org/en/faq#sentence-collection).
Hope you enjoyed the reading and planning to validate or donate your voice for the right cause. Also, I hope and believe that either the big existing technological companies or other parties will take advantage of such a significant data set and will make our lives more accessible.
